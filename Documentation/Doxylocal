# If the FULL_PATH_NAMES tag is set to YES then the STRIP_FROM_PATH tag
# can be used to strip a user-defined part of the path. Stripping is
# only done if one of the specified strings matches the left-hand part of
# the path. The tag can be used to show relative paths in the file list.
# If left blank the directory from which doxygen is run is used as the
# path to strip.

# The OUTPUT_DIRECTORY tag is used to specify the (relative or absolute)

# where doxygen was started. If left blank the current directory will be used.

# The LAYOUT_FILE tag can be used to specify a layout file which will be parsed
# by doxygen. The layout file controls the global structure of the generated
# output files in an output format independent way. The create the layout file
# that represents doxygen's defaults, run doxygen with the -l option.
# You can optionally specify a file name after the option, if omitted
# DoxygenLayout.xml will be used as the name of the layout file.

# The HTML_EXTRA_STYLESHEET tag can be used to specify an additional
# user-defined cascading style sheet that is included after the standard
# style sheets created by doxygen. Using this option one can overrule
# certain style aspects. This is preferred over using HTML_STYLESHEET
# since it does not replace the standard style sheet and is therefor more
# robust against future updates. Doxygen will copy the style sheet file to
# the output directory.
