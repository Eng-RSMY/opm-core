Open Porous Media Core Library
==============================

These are release notes for opm-core.


CONTENT
-------

opm-core is the core library within OPM and contains the following 

* Eclipse deck input and preprosessing
* Fluid properties (basic PVT models and rock properties)
* Grid handling (cornerpoint grids, unstructured grid interface)
* Linear Algebra (interface to different linear solvers)
* Pressure solvers (various discretization schemes, flow models)
* Simulators (some basic examples of simulators based on sequential splitting schemes)
* Transport solvers (various discretization schemes, flow models)
* Utilities (input and output processing, unit conversion)
* Wells (basic well handling)


LICENSE
-------

The library is distributed under the GNU General Public License,
version 3 or later (GPLv3+).


PLATFORMS
---------

The opm-core module is designed to run on Linux platforms. It is also
regularly run on Mac OS X. No efforts have been made to ensure that
the code will compile and run on windows platforms.

RETRIEVING AND BUILDING DUNE PREREQUISITES
------------------------------------------

(only necessary if you want to use opm-core as a dune module)

# trust DUNE certificate (sic)
echo p | svn list https://svn.dune-project.org/svn/dune-common

# checkout DUNE libraries
for module in common istl geometry grid localfunctions; do
  git svn clone -s \
    https://svn.dune-project.org/svn/dune-$module/branches/release-2.2/ \
	dune-$module
done

# building DUNE libraries
for module in common istl geometry grid localfunctions; do
  env CCACHE_DISABLE=1 dune-common/bin/dunecontrol --only=dune-$module \
    --configure-opts="--enable-fieldvector-size-is-method" \
	--make-opts="-j -l 0.8" autogen : configure : make
done


DOWNLOADING
-----------

For a read-only download:
git clone git://github.com/OPM/opm-core.git

If you want to contribute, fork OPM/opm-core on github.


BUILDING
--------

(standalone opm-core:)

 cd ../opm-core
 autoreconf -i
 ./configure
 make
 sudo make install

(using opm-core as a dune module:)

 # note: this is done from the parent directory of opm-core
 env CCACHE_DISABLE=1 dune-common/bin/dunecontrol --only=opm-core \
   --configure-opts="" --make-opts="-j -l 0.8" autogen : configure : make



DOCUMENTATION
-------------

Efforts have been made to document the code with Doxygen.
In order to build the documentation, enter the command
$ doxygen
in the topmost directory.
