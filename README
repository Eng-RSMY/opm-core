* Grid handling (cornerpoint grids, unstructured grid interface)
* Linear Algebra (interface to different linear solvers)
* Pressure solvers (various discretization schemes, flow models)
* Simulators (some basic examples of simulators based on sequential splitting schemes)
* Transport solvers (various discretization schemes, flow models)
* Utilities (input and output processing, unit conversion)
* Wells (basic well handling)
