These are the release notes for opm-core

Open Porous Media Core Library

CONTENT
opm-core is the core library within OPM and contains the following 

* Eclipse preprosessing
* Fluid properties (basic PVT models and rock properties)
* Grid (generates different grids)
* Linear Algerbra (interface to different linear solvers)
* Pressure solvers (different discretization schemes, different flow models)
* Simulator (some basic examples of simulators based on sequential schemes)
* Transport solvers (different discretization schemes, different flow models)
* Utility (input and output processing, unit conversion)
* Wells (basic well handling)

ON WHAT PLATFORMS DOES IT RUN?
The opm-core module is designed to run on linux platforms. No efforts have
been made to ensure that the code will compile and run on windows platforms.

DOCUMENTATION
Efforts have been made to document the code with Doxygen.

BUILDING opm-core

# note: this is done from the parent directory of opm-core
env CCACHE_DISABLE=1 dune-common/bin/dunecontrol --only=opm-core \
  --configure-opts="" --make-opts="-j -l 0.8" autogen : configure : make

or, without using dunecontrol:

pushd opm-core
autoreconf -i
./configure
make
sudo make install
