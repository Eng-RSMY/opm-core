/**
 * Controls for a single well.
 * Each control specifies a well rate or bottom-hole pressure. Only
 * one control can be active at a time, indicated by current. The
 * meaning of each control's target value depends on the control type:
 *
 *  - BHP            -> target pressure in Pascal.
 *  - RESERVOIR_RATE -> target reservoir volume rate in cubic(meter)/second
 *  - SURFACE_RATE   -> target surface volume rate in cubic(meter)/second
 *
 * The sign convention for RATE targets is as follows:
 *
 *  - (+) Fluid flowing into reservoir, i.e. injecting.
 *  - (-) Fluid flowing out of reservoir, i.e. producing.
 *
 * For *_RATE controls, the distribution of phases used for the control
 * is also needed. For example, a total rate control should have 1.0
 * for each phase, whereas a control on oil rate should have 1.0 for
 * the oil phase and 0.0 for the rest. For BHP controls, this is unused.
 * The active control acts as an equality constraint, whereas the
 * non-active controls should be interpreted as inequality
 * constraints (upper or lower bounds).  For instance, a PRODUCER's
 * BHP constraint defines a minimum acceptable bottom-hole pressure
 * value for the well.
