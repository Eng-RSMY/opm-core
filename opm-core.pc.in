# This is the configuration for local builds. Use this by putting the
# compilation output path (the directory in which you ran ./configure)
# into the environment variable PKG_CONFIG_PATH. This will enable you
# to use pkg-config in your code while making changes to opm-core.

# This is NOT the file that is installed in the system directories when
# you do `make install`. That is the one in lib/pkgconfig. However, if
# you make changes here, you should consider that one as well.
