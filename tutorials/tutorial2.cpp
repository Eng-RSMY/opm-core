/// \page tutorial2 Flow Solver for a single phase 
/// \details The flow equations consist of the mass conservation equation
/// \f[\nabla\cdot u=q\f] and the Darcy law \f[u=-\frac{1}{\mu}K\nabla p.\f] Here,
/// \f$u\f$ denotes the velocity and \f$p\f$ the pressure. The permeability tensor is
/// given by \f$K\f$ and \f$\mu\f$ denotes the viscosity. 
/// 
/// We solve the flow equations for a carthesian grid and we set the source term
/// \f$q\f$ be zero except at the left-lower and right-upper corner, where it is equal 
/// with opposite sign (inflow equal to outflow).
